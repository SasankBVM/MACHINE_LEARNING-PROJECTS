# MACHINE_LEARNING-PROJECTS
THIS FOLDER INCLUDES MACHINE-LEARNING PROJECTS.

PROJECT-1: Advertising Dataset

This project is based on data whether an user clicked a particular website.
This includes some Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering.
This is developed using Logistic_Regression machine learning algorithm.

PROJECT-2: Diabetes Detection 

This project is based on the detection of diabetes for a person based on some medical metrics.

PROJECT-3: E-commerce Customer analysis

This project is based on predicting the "Yearly Amount Spent" by the customers in an E-commerce company using machine learning algorithms. 
This also includes a few notions on which platform(application/website) people tend to buy more products.
This is developed using Linear_Regression machine learning algorithm.

PROJECT-4: PARKINSON'S DISEASE PREDICTION

This is a machine learning project to detect a neuro disorder named Parkinson's disease.
Techniques to deal with Oversampling, Feature selection etc. are discussed in the project.
Various classification machine learning models such as Random Forest,Support Vector Machine, KNN are implemented and compared to enhance the maximum productivity of the project.

PROJECT-5: RANDOMIZED DATA ANALYSIS USING KNN

Given any random data and a Target-class, we need to design a Machine Learning model which takes the input data, learns from it and predict the correct 
outcome for any future data. 
For this purpose I used K-Nearest Neighbor Classifier, for this I designed an Elbow curve which gives us the optimal K-value to predict the correct class.
