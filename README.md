# MACHINE_LEARNING-PROJECTS
THIS FOLDER INCLUDES MACHINE-LEARNING PROJECTS.

PROJECT-1: E-commerce Customer analysis
This project is based on predicting the "Yearly Amount Spent" by the customers in an E-commerce company using machine learning algorithms. 
This also includes a few notions on which platform(application/website) people tend to buy more products.
This is developed using Linear_Regression machine learning algorithm.

PROJECT-2: Advertising Dataset
This project is based on data whether an user clicked a particular website.
This includes some Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering.
This is developed using Logistic_Regression machine learning algorithm.

PROJECT-3: RANDOMIZED DATA ANALYSIS USING KNN
Given any random data and a Target-class, we need to design a Machine Learning model which takes the input data, learns from it and predict the correct 
outcome for any future data. 
For this purpose I used K-Nearest Neighbor Classifier, for this I designed an Elbow curve which gives us the optimal K-value to predict the correct class.
